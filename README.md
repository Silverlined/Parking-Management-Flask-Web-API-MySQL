# Parking Management API

## 1. Application Setup
`Flask application`
## 2. Define and Access the Database
`The application will use a MySQL database to store any parking related data`
## 3. Blueprints and Views
`A view function is the code you write to respond to requests to your application. Flask uses patterns to match the incoming request URL to the view that should handle it. The view returns data that Flask turns into an outgoing response. Flask can also go the other direction and generate a URL to a view based on its name and arguments.`

## Usage

All responses will have the form

```json
{
    "data": "Mixed type holding the content of the response",
    "message": "Description of what happened"
}
```

Subsequent response definitions will only detail the expected value of the `data field`
